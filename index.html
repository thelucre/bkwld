                        In 2007 Sam Lord's Castle was bought by CLICO (Barbados), but due to financial woes, the redevelopment didn't happen. For a while the Government of Barbados was proposing a buy-out. On 20 October 2010 Sam Lord's Castle was gutted by a major fire.

                            Escargot is a dish of cooked land snails, usually served as an appetizer in France and in French restaurants. The word escargot is also sometimes applied to the living snails of those species which are commonly eaten in this way.
